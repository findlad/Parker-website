      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Parker Guitars</strong> was an American manufacturer of
        <em>electric and acoustic guitars</em> and basses, founded by luthier
        <a href="https://kenparkerarchtops.com/" target="_blank">Ken Parker</a>
        in 1993. Parker guitars were distinguished for their characteristic
        light weight and the use of composite materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parker's most famous guitar was the Fly model, an electric guitar made
        with a slim, lightweight core of real wood (such as spruce, poplar, or
        basswood, for example), reinforced with a carbon fiber exoskeleton to
        provide unparalleled rigidity for a solid body electric guitar. The
        mixture of materials also resulted in a lighter instrument than had been
        available up to that time, weighing a mere 2 kg (4.4 lb). Musicians
        highly appreciated the early "Fly" models and well-received by critics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Parker company was acquired by the U.S. Music Corporation in 2003,
        which was itself sold to Jam Industries in August 2009. As of November
        2016, the brand was inactive after the factory in Illinois was closed.
      </p>
      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>
        The Fly was the first model produced by Parker. The guitars (left) and
        basses (right) were made using traditional tone woods and composite
        materials, resulting in light weight instruments The first model
        launched by Parker was the Fly in 1993. Designed by Ken Parker and Larry
        Fishman, this model was unique for its use of composite materials and
        light weight. The guitar's combination of traditional magnetic pickups
        and piezo-electrics in the bridge allowed players to achieve both
        electric and acoustic tones. Perhaps most significant to the guitar's
        design is the almost complete absence of a neck heel to permit greater
        ease of access to the uppermost frets. Parker guitars were characterized
        as thin and ultra-lightweight instruments; they were generally made from
        lighter woods like poplar, basswood, and spruce, although there were
        maple and mahogany Fly models. They had composite materials (resin,
        epoxy and carbon glass skin) to reinforce a thin carved body and neck.
        Fingerboards were composite and use stainless steel frets. Electronics
        include the integrated use of coil split humbuckers, single coil and
        piezo pickups with active circuitry. The proprietary vibrato bridge used
        a unique flat steel spring which helped the guitar to maintain the
        pitch. The vibrato had three settings; bend down only, full floating and
        locked.
      </p>

      <p>
        In October 2002, Parker initiated the first production run of the Fly
        bass guitar, in both 4-string and 5-string versions. The 5-strings were
        noted for their ease of use for 4-string players, both with respect to
        weight and string spacing. Parker 4-string basses produced in the
        original factory in Wilmington, MA shipped in 2003 and had seven-digit
        serial numbers using the same formula for dating as the original NiteFly
        guitars while 5-string basses were shipped first and had six-digit
        numbers that begin with 092 reflecting the 2002 manufacturing. Basses
        made by U.S. Music Corporation used the same seven-digit formula
        continuing the 4-string serial number and dating.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with other Parker guitars, they offered both magnetic and
        piezoelectric pickups, with the ability to blend the two. The Fly Bass
        was discontinued in 2008 and Parker currently offers 4- and 5-string
        basses with the newer MaxxFly shape. The last original Fly guitars, with
        the balance wheel on the face of the guitar and the four-knob layout,
        appeared in 2003. That same year, the Fly was "refined" with a new
        control layout, consisting of a master volume, a master tone (with
        coil-split function) and a master volume for the piezo, eliminating the
        separate volume control for the magnetic pickups and the piezo tone
        control. Numerous other changes were made as well. Several Special
        edition Flys were also introduced in later years. Major names in these
        were; the Fly Mojo Snakeskin, stock guitars covered in snakeskin; the
        "Four Seasons" Fly Mojos with thematically coresponding finishes; and a
        koa Fly Mojo released as part of the Select series. In 2010, the MaxxFly
        model was introduced. Based on the Fly, the MaxxFly features a modified
        headstock (allowing the instrument to be hung a standard guitar wall
        hanger), a modified top horn (more ergonomically and traditionally
        shaped), standardized pickup cavities, 22 frets instead of 24, and a
        slightly thicker, heavier body. It shares the same general construction
        as the standard Fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parker sold his company to the U.S. Music Corporation in 2003, most of
        the guitars started to be manufactured outside the United States. In
        September 2021, the Parker Guitars trademark was purchased and renewed
        by Fishpark LLC., an Enterprise headed by Lawrence Fishman.
