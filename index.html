      <h1>Parker Guitars</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Parker Guitars</strong> was an American manufacturer of
        <em>electric and acoustic guitars</em>[1] and basses, founded by luthier
        Ken Parker in 1993. Parker guitars were distinguished for their
        characteristic light weight and the use of composite materials.[2]
      </p>
      <p>
        Parker's most famous guitar was the Fly model, an electric guitar made
        with a slim, lightweight core of real wood (such as spruce, poplar, or
        basswood, for example),[3] reinforced with a carbon fiber exoskeleton to
        provide unparalleled rigidity for a solid body electric guitar.[4] The
        mixture of materials also resulted in a lighter instrument than had been
        available up to that time, weighing a mere 2 kg (4.4 lb). Musicians
        highly appreciated the early "Fly" models and well-received by
        critics.[5]

        The Parker company was acquired by the U.S. Music Corporation in 2003,
        which was itself sold to Jam Industries in August 2009. As of November
        2016, the brand was inactive after the factory in Illinois was closed.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        The Fly was the first model produced by Parker. The guitars (left) and
        basses (right) were made using traditional tone woods and composite
        materials, resulting in light weight instruments The first model
        launched by Parker was the Fly in 1993. Designed by Ken Parker and Larry
        Fishman, this model was unique for its use of composite materials and
        light weight. The guitar's combination of traditional magnetic pickups
        and piezo-electrics in the bridge allowed players to achieve both
        electric and acoustic tones. Perhaps most significant to the guitar's
        design is the almost complete absence of a neck heel to permit greater
        ease of access to the uppermost frets.[6] Parker guitars were
        characterized as thin and ultra-lightweight instruments; they were
        generally made from lighter woods like poplar, basswood, and spruce,
        although there were maple and mahogany Fly models. They had composite
        materials (resin, epoxy and carbon glass skin) to reinforce a thin
        carved body and neck. Fingerboards were composite and use stainless
        steel frets. Electronics include the integrated use of coil split
        humbuckers, single coil and piezo pickups with active circuitry. The
        proprietary vibrato bridge used a unique flat steel spring which helped
        the guitar to maintain the pitch. The vibrato had three settings; bend
        down only, full floating and locked. In October 2002, Parker initiated
        the first production run of the Fly bass guitar, in both 4-string and
        5-string versions. The 5-strings were noted for their ease of use for
        4-string players, both with respect to weight and string spacing. Parker
        4-string basses produced in the original factory in Wilmington, MA
        shipped in 2003 and had seven-digit serial numbers using the same
        formula for dating as the original NiteFly guitars while 5-string basses
        were shipped first and had six-digit numbers that begin with 092
        reflecting the 2002 manufacturing. Basses made by U.S. Music Corporation
        used the same seven-digit formula continuing the 4-string serial number
        and dating. As with other Parker guitars, they offered both magnetic and
        piezoelectric pickups, with the ability to blend the two. The Fly Bass
        was discontinued in 2008 and Parker currently offers 4- and 5-string
        basses with the newer MaxxFly shape. The last original Fly guitars, with
        the balance wheel on the face of the guitar and the four-knob layout,
        appeared in 2003. That same year, the Fly was "refined" with a new
        control layout, consisting of a master volume, a master tone (with
        coil-split function) and a master volume for the piezo, eliminating the
        separate volume control for the magnetic pickups and the piezo tone
        control. Numerous other changes were made as well.[example needed]
        Several Special edition Flys were also introduced in later years. Major
        names in these were; the Fly Mojo Snakeskin, stock guitars covered in
        snakeskin; the "Four Seasons" Fly Mojos with thematically corresponding
        finishes; and a koa Fly Mojo released as part of the Select series. In
        2010, the MaxxFly model was introduced. Based on the Fly, the MaxxFly
        features a modified headstock (allowing the instrument to be hung a
        standard guitar wall hanger), a modified top horn (more ergonomically
        and traditionally shaped), standardized pickup cavities, 22 frets
        instead of 24, and a slightly thicker, heavier body. It shares the same
        general construction as the standard Fly.

        Parker sold his company to the U.S. Music Corporation in 2003, most of
        the guitars started to be manufactured outside the United States.[2] In
        September 2021, the Parker Guitars trademark was purchased and renewed
        by Fishpark LLC., an Enterprise headed by Lawrence Fishman.[7]
